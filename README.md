# etch-a-sketch

The etch - a - Skech project went much smoother than antcipated.
I started off with creating the an input field to obtain the desired 
grid size.

I then created a div with class name container which would house the 
grid to be created.

I somewhat srtuggled to create a div dynamically but soon figured it out.

I then struggled to create multiple divs and have them sized correctly.

I then went and sat doen to figure out how I could create all these divs 
in one go. I remembered that you could access a foor loop within a foor loop.

After I had created the grid I added a clear function to reset the grid and start fresh.

I then created a function in JS to dynamically change the background color of 
my divs when you hover over them.

Finally I added the rgb function to it that continuously changes the 
color to a different one when passed over.
